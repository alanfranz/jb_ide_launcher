Linux launcher for Jetbrains IDEs, with dock support.

Allows the IDE to correctly work with Docky/AWN; each IDE will have its own icon and won't be exchanged for a different Swing app.
Otherwise you'll probably get a lot of different apps grouped under the very same icon in docks.

Currently supports:

IDEA 10/11
PyCharm 1.x
RubyMine 3.x


Usage:
launcher.sh [WM_CLASS_NAME] [script_to_launch, i.e. idea.sh or pycharm.sh] 
Examples:

launcher.sh IDEA /opt/idea/bin/idea.sh 
launcher.sh RubyMine rubymine.sh


Reccomended usage for installing desktop entry, in order for your menu to work:

- untar IDE file somewhere, e.g.

cd
mkdir dev
cd dev
tar xvf ~/Downloads/idea-IC-123.tar.gz

- create a symlink for ide type; this will prevent you from needing to upgrade the launcher at every update, just update the symlink.

ln -s idea-IC-123 idea

- clone git repo for jb_ide_launcher


cd ~/dev
git clone git://github.com/alanfranz/jb_ide_launcher.git
cd jb_ide_launcher

./install_for IDEA_IC ~/dev/idea



- you should now get a menu entry in your programming or development menu; drag such entry 
 into your dock, and you're done!
