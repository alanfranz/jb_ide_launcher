Linux launcher for Jetbrains IDEs, with dock support.

Allows the IDE to correctly work with Docky/AWN; each IDE will have its own icon and won't be exchanged for a different Swing app.

Currently supports:

IDEA 10/11
PyCharm 1.x
RubyMine 3.x


Usage:
launcher.sh [script_to_launch, i.e. idea.sh or pycharm.sh] [WM_CLASS_NAME]

Examples:

launcher.sh /opt/idea/bin/idea.sh IDEA
launcher.sh rubymine.sh RubyMine
